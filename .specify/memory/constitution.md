# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accuracy
All technical content must reflect real-world robotics, ROS2, Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity, and VLA systems.

### II. Clarity
Explain concepts step-by-step for advanced learners and engineers.

### III. Pedagogical Rigor
Chapters include theory, practical examples, and exercises.

### IV. Consistency
Terminology, style, and formatting are uniform across chapters.

### V. Safety & Ethics
Emphasize safe and responsible robotics practices in all hands-on instructions.

## Key Standards

- **Chapter structure**: Title → Executive Summary → Learning Objectives → Conceptual Overview → Deep Technical Explanation → Practical Workflow → Case Studies → Exercises → Summary → Glossary → References
- **Markdown formatting**: H1 for chapters, H2/H3 for sections, fenced code blocks for code/commands.
- **Commands**: Valid ROS2, Python, Bash, or shell syntax.
- **Diagrams**: ASCII or textual conceptual diagrams where necessary.
- **References**: Authoritative sources only (documentation, research papers, or product specs).
- **Writing style**: Professional, human-like, precise, and instructional.

## Constraints

- **Target audience**: Intermediate to advanced learners in AI, robotics, or engineering.
- **Chapters must be self-contained and render correctly in Docusaurus.**
- **Avoid hallucinations, fictional hardware, or unsafe instructions.**
- **Maintain continuity with prior chapters.**
- **Chapter length**: Approx. 2,000–4,000 words depending on complexity.

## Success Criteria
- Chapters follow structure and formatting rules strictly.
- Technical content is accurate and verifiable.
- Exercises and examples are practical and runnable in simulation or on hardware.
- Terminology and style are consistent across the textbook.
- Safe practices are clearly highlighted in all hands-on instructions.

## Governance

Amendments to this constitution require documentation, review, and approval from the project lead. All content contributions must adhere to these principles.
